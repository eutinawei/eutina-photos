### Description
This website is my photography portfolio, and the purpose of this website is to display the photography I have taken after I came to the states. It mainly contains photos I took from Boston, Chicago, Washington DC, and Pittsburgh.

I made the website engaging by designing and developing the home page with a scrollable timeline. The photos are categorized by location and timing, and users can scroll and click on the location they are interested in. Also, to make my website more interactive, on the detail page, users can click on a particular image to enlarge it.

### How to Use the Website
- Enter the website using https://eutina-photos.web.app
- ***If tired of the typewriter effect, just go to*** https://eutina-photos.web.app/home
- On the home page, scroll right to view different location options
- To enter detail pages, hover or click on the dot of a certain location you prefer
- Click on a image to enlarge it
- To go back to home page, simply click on **eutina wei**
- To view about page, click on **about**

### External Libraries
- React.js
  - React is known for reusable components. Since this is a photography portfolio, detail pages for various locations are generally the same. Therefore, it would be easier for me to develop a component and reuse it for similar pages.
- react-router-dom
  - To specify a variety of routes.
- styled-components
  - To specify the styles for components more easily.

### Iteration from HW7
During the development process, I added a RWD design in detail pages. If users view the detail pages using mobile phones, the photos would be displayed in one column.

### Major Challenges
The hardest part is adding the animation and transition for the scrollable timeline. Although I successfully developed what I envisioned and designed, the codes could be refactored to be more concise and elegant.
