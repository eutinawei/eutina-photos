### c. Description
This website is my photography portfolio, and the purpose of this website is to display the photography I have taken after I came to the states. It mainly contains photos I took from Boston, Chicago, and Washington DC.

I made the website engaging by designing and developing the home page with a scrollable timeline. The photos are categorized by location and timing, and users can scroll and click on the location they are interested in. Also, to make my website more interactive, on the detail page, users can click on a particular image to enlarge it.
