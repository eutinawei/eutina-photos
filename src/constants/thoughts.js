    "text": "Art museums are, the majority of the time, particularly intimidating and incredibly humbling. Before entering one, I must be aware and fully embrace the fact that I barely know anything, it is impossible to realize complete empathy inside (though it is also the case outside, or more precisely, in all directions and all manner of ways), and there exists no objective perfection. Nonetheless, the acknowledgment of the above facts does not stop me from trying. On the contrary, it has been the deep understanding of how powerless I am and how uncontrollable the experience is that allows me to walk in assuringly.\n\nBeing surrounded by art, I concentrate on dissolving my physical body and projecting my life experiences, emotions, beliefs, and soul into art pieces. This is the only thing I can do. No matter how transparent my physical self becomes, I still exist, I am still standing, and humans can never turn into mirrors. Those artists’ life experiences, emotions, beliefs, and souls pervade the environment, yet I can only imagine and absorb them without the ability to perfectly reflect.\n\nRegardless, this whole process and the struggling attempts of communication are precisely the beauty of visiting art museums. It is the weight of expectations and those irrefutable failures that keeps me going."

    "text": "In retrospect, it was the most beautiful day of my life. Every single moment was immaculate. But back then, I was flooded with melancholy and failed to acknowledge that.\n\nIt was Aug 1st, one of the hottest days in Taiwan that year, almost 40°C or 104°F. I could sense the sunlight shooting toward me like arrows in every possible direction. There was no cloud above for me to hide. I realized that I could no longer eschew my feelings like I always did. I heard the leaves rustling beside me as I tasted the saltiness of my tears. The world was crumbling. I felt dizzy. All I could do was to spend all my efforts trying to keep my back straight and keep walking. \"Stop ridiculing me!\" I could hear the wind whispering that we all knew this was coming.\n\nFinally, I arrived at Rebirth. Kevin stood behind the bar table and looked at me silently as he was busy wiping the glasses and preparing to open the cafe. I had always been afraid of looking into his unfathomable eyes. He owned the ability to see through my deception and all my camouflage. \"Brown sugar latte?\" His lips barely moved. \"No... can I get a cup of plain coffee this time\" I struggled to finish my sentence while sobbing intensely. He sighed, handed me a stack of tissues, and headed to the kitchen to look for some equipment. I believed he knew I was there to say goodbye since I had just lost the only reason that once allowed me to visit that place.\n\nEvery detail is still brutally vivid. I can remember how bitter the coffee was. Kevin said that he added spoons of alcohol. I can also recall him standing there at a short distance, sighing again and handing me a cup of hot chocolate after thirty minutes of me taking the tiniest sips of the coffee. I could never become the person I wish to be, so I have been adamant about refusing to drink coffee or alcohol from then on.\n\nThe most beautiful moment happened when I got home. My mental state was led to the middle of nowhere, and the darkness disgusted me. I tried to lie down while feeling extremely nauseous. Then the next moment, I found myself falling down the bed and struggling to climb to the bathroom. I vomited all the way there. When I sat on the bathroom floor and gasped in pain, I looked back. There were hundreds of flowers blooming in chocolate color. I could see them forming a mesmerizing trajectory, guiding me to even more profound despair.\n\nThat was when I encountered the aesthetic of destruction. I was indulged in my own existence.\n\nI have to admit my addiction toward sorrow and misery. Every moment is, in fact, invariably austere in objectivity. We project our thoughts and feelings to those moments and give them meanings ourselves. I envy Mizoguchi for possessing the ultimate beauty in his mind, the one that exceeds any possible entity in reality, the one that is perpetually out of reach, and the one that fails his expectation only when he allows it to. Its significance is forever ruled by his consciousness.\n\nHowever, the moment I reach the ultimate beauty, I will undoubtedly stop pursuing it. Therefore, the ultimate beauty only exists in things yet to be known. As Kashiwagi stated, it is the knowledge that changes the world, not action.\n\nAnd when I finally meet the ultimate beauty, to eternally own it, I must destroy it."
